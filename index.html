               GeoMesa is an open source suite of tools that enables large-scale geospatial querying and analytics on distributed computing systems.
               GeoMesa provides spatio-temporal indexing on top of the Accumulo, HBase, Google Bigtable and Cassandra databases for massive storage of point, line,
               and polygon data. GeoMesa also provides near real time stream processing of spatio-temporal data by layering spatial semantics on top of Apache Kafka.
               Through GeoServer, GeoMesa facilitates integration with a wide range of existing mapping clients over standard OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) APIs and
               protocols such as WFS and WMS. GeoMesa supports Apache Spark for custom distributed geospatial analytics.

            <section id="quick-start">
<h2>Quick start</h2>
            <p>Navigate to where you would like to download the project and run:</p>
            <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/locationtech/geomesa/ && cd geomesa && build/mvn clean install -DskipTests</code></pre></div>

            <p>GeoMesa is managed by <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, and is built with the <code>build/mvn clean install -DskipTests</code> command.</p>
            <p>The above command builds each GeoMesa sub-project with its additional dependencies-included JAR.</p>

            <section id="FAQ">
                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h3>What is the best way to ingest data into GeoMesa?</h2>
                <p>The GeoMesa command line tools provide an easy way to ingest data in
                   variety of formats. Tools distributions are provided for all major
                   back-end implemenations. See the user guide for information on setting
                   up the command line tools:

                </p>

                <a name="queries-hang"></a>
                <h3>Why do my queries hang (never finish)?</h2>
                <p>Although it is possible to request such a large number of records
                that queries timeout or appear never to finish, the far more frequent cause of this
                behavior is a mis-configured cloud.  Check to be sure that ports are open on
                all nodes; that clock-time is reasonably consistent among the nodes; and
                that all software versions are the same across your cluster.</p>

                <a name="tables-naming-convention"></a>
                <h3>Why are there multiple tables for my one feature?</h2>
                <p>GeoMesa supports secondary indexes, and we do this by using
                multiple support tables per feature (or group of features). See
                <a href="http://www.geomesa.org/documentation/user/datastores/index_overview.html">Index Overview</a>
                for a discussion of the various indices used by GeoMesa.</p>

                <a name="epsg-acls"></a>
                <h3>Why is my CRS not being read?</h2>
                <p>If the GeoTools packages for reading EPSG data are on your classpath,
                review the permissions on your temporary directory. If multiple users share
                an environment, the temporary directory containing EPSG data
                can be owned by a different user.</p>
                <p>Another option is to ensure that you are using your own, specific
                directory.  To do that, include <code>-Djava.io.tmpdir=/tmp/YourUsername</code>
                (substituting your username) when running a JVM.</p>

                <a name="geotools-spi"></a>
                <h3>What do I need to do to include GeoMesa in a shaded JAR?</h2>
                <p>If you rebundle GeoMesa as part of a larger project's JAR file,
                it is important to ensure that the manifest includes the proper
                entries for the service-provider interfaces (SPIs); otherwise, the
                various factories will be unable to find the implementations you
                expect.</p>
